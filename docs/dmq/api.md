*The following API reference is subject to change without notice.*

- `date`
    + The date of citation. In RFC-3339 format.
      Only date is used, time is ignored.
      Watch out for time zones, as it can shift by 1 day.
      If you send `2025-05-27T23:00-01:00`, the API ignores time zone and will use *2025-05-27* instead of intended *2025-05-28*
      To avoid it use UTC, with `Z` at the end of timestamp.
    + Example: `2025-05-28T00:00:00.000Z`
- `text`
    + the citation text itself.
- `sourceDriveFolderId`
    + ID of root Google Drive Folder containing folders of images. The example of expeted structure is
